# ADR-0001: Application Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to design a scalable application architecture that can handle complex business logic while maintaining separation of concerns.

## Decision

We will use a layered architecture with the following layers:

1. **API Layer** - Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. **Services Layer** - Contains business logic
3. **Controllers Layer** - Orchestrates service calls
4. **Models Layer** - Defines data structures
5. **Utils Layer** - Provides common utilities
6. **Middleware Layer** - Handles cross-cutting concerns
7. **Config Layer** - Manages configuration

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual layers
- Maintainable codebase
- Scalable architecture

### Negative
- More boilerplate code
- Potential over-engineering for simple features
- Learning curve for new developers

## Implementation

Each layer will be implemented as separate modules with clear interfaces between them.
