# ADR-0002: Authentication Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to implement secure authentication for our application that can handle user sessions and API access.

## Decision

We will use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication with the following approach:

1. **Token-based authentication** - No server-side sessions
2. **JWT with HMAC-SHA256** - Secure token signing
3. **Refresh tokens** - For long-term authentication
4. **Password hashing** - Using SHA-256 with salt

## Consequences

### Positive
- Stateless authentication
- Scalable across multiple servers
- Secure token-based approach
- Easy to implement

### Negative
- Tokens cannot be revoked easily
- Larger token size compared to session IDs
- Requires careful token management

## Implementation

- AuthService handles token generation and verification
- AuthMiddleware validates tokens on protected routes
- PasswordHash utility handles secure password hashing
- JWT utility manages token operations
