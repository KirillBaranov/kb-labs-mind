# ADR-0002: Dependency Management Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to decide how to handle external dependencies in the project.

## Decision
We will use:
- Lodash for utility functions
- TypeScript for development
- Minimal external dependencies
- Path mapping for internal modules

## Consequences
- Reduced bundle size
- Better tree shaking
- Clear internal module structure
- Type safety for imports
