# ADR-0001: Project Architecture Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish the basic architecture for the medium project fixture.

## Decision
We will use a layered architecture with:
- Services layer for business logic
- Utils layer for shared utilities
- Configuration management
- TypeScript for type safety

## Consequences
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual components
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Configuration is centralized
